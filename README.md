To create new links you can click the "Create a New Link" button on the /urls page, or alternatively click "Create New URL" on the navigation header.

While logged in you can delete links from the My URLs (/urls) page, delete is a simple click.

If you wish to edit any links, navigate to the My URLs (/urls) page and click the "edit" button, this will navigate you to the edit screen where you may input the new URL into the form and click "update", this will redirect you to the My URLs (/urls) where your updated URL will appear.

When you are finished up with creating and sharing your URLs, Don't forget to logout! Just click the logout button at the top right where your email is shown!
